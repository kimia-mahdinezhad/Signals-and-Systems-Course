# Signals and Systems Course

## Overview

This repository serves as an archive of coursework completed during the Signals and Systems course undertaken as part of my university program. The course delved into various fundamental topics related to analog signal and systems analysis. It provided a comprehensive understanding of concepts ranging from signal decomposition to advanced techniques like convolution, feature extraction, filtering, modulation, and transform methods.

## Course Topics

Throughout the course, I gained knowledge in the following topics:

1. **Introduction of Analog Signal and System**: An overview of analog signals and systems, laying the foundation for the course.

2. **Signal Decomposition**: Understanding the principles of breaking down complex signals into simpler components.

3. **Time-Independent Linear System**: In-depth exploration of linear systems and their properties.

4. **Convolution for Continuous Systems**: The concept of convolution and its application in continuous systems.

5. **Feature Extraction**: Techniques such as histogram analysis, target detection, texture analysis, gradient analysis, and scale space transformation for signal processing.

6. **Filtering and Modulation**: Examining filtering and modulation methods applied to signals.

7. **Hilbert Transform**: Introduction to the Hilbert transform and its use in signal processing.

8. **Sampling and Generalized Fourier Transform (GFT)**: Sampling theory and the Generalized Fourier Transform for signal analysis.

9. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace Transform and its relevance to system analysis.

10. **Z-Transform**: Understanding the Z-Transform and its role in signal and system analysis.
